# Solution

The project aims to provide a lightweight framework for agent based task planning
and execution.  Users interact with a single entry point (`PlanningFlow`) and the
framework automatically generates a plan, executes each step and produces a
summary.  Tools and agents can be swapped out or extended without modifying the
core flow logic.

Key design goals:
- **Modularity**: agents and tools are defined in separate modules.
- **Ease of extension**: new tools or agents can be registered with the flow.
- **Configurability**: LLM and proxy settings are specified via `config.toml`.

This approach allows rapid experimentation with different agents or LLM backends
while keeping the orchestration simple.
The framework now ships with a domain specialist agent and sample YAML workflows for industry scenarios.
